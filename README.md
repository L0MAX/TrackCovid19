Coronavirus live update and tracker android app built in Java.
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.

Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness 
and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical 
problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more 
likely to develop serious illness.

This live tracker keeps you updated on the cases regarding the corona virus pandemic and also provides
preventive measures as well.
